            <p>So, you've found yourself in the possession of a Violet, and are frightened of their erratic behaviour. Well no need to worry. In this survival guide, you will be taught some of the most important things to keep in mind about them so things don't end disastrously for you.</p>

                1. Be Anyone Except Dad
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is perhaps the most important rule. Years of observation has proven that dad has always shouldered the brunt of the consequences of owning a Violet. Whether that be through being a victim of biting, sock theft, tugging, or any of the other situations mentioned in this article.<br>We don't know why this is the case. But needless to say. Don't be dad.

                2. Give Them Pieces of Food To Keep Them At Bay
            </h2>
            <p>
                Begging and guilt tripping are two of a Violet's main ways to manipulate their owners. The only way to end this torment unfortunately seems to be droppping pieces of food to distract and temper them. However, as with all types of dogs, it is important to remember that choclate and onions are off limits.<br>You may run into a situation however, where you have already given them food not 10 seconds ago, yet they still ask for more. This doesn't matter. they'll still pretend that you haven't fed them in decades by giving you puppy eyes and sucking in their stomach. You have to do it anyways for a moment of peace.

                3. Watch Out For Speed
            </h2>
            <p>
                When over-excited, a Violet can be a speeding bullet; running in circles, or running up and down areas with no regard for your safety. In this situation it is recommended to stay as far away from them as possible. To mitigate the risk of being trampled.

                4. Doggy Distraction With Ball
            </h2>
            <p>
                Speaking of over-excitement. If you take your Violet for a walk. Be sure to to bring a ball with you to distract them from other dogs if they come by. Just take the ball and call the Violet whilst showing them the ball, until they are captivated by it whilst the dog walks past. This will save you from what we will discuss in point 7.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Never let a Violet out of your sight. If you do, they are prone to pick up and even eat things they shouldn't. This can involve dog poo, pieces of rubbish, food they shouldn't eat and more.<br>Especially when the are young, they are known to swallow stones, which can lead to health complications that require surgery.

                6. Socks Are a Violet Magnet
            </h2>
            <p>
                For unknown reasons, Violets are especially captivated by socks. And given the chance, will take and chew on them. Requiring you to ask them to give them back. Surprisingly, out of mercy, this usually works very quickly. And if it doesn't, repeatedly ask for them back and they'll give in.<br> Again, it is unknown why this works, it just does.

                7. A Hurricane of Terror
            </h2>
            <p>
                When a Violet is over-excited, they are known to turn into tornados of horror. This can take the form of different behaviours. Including jumping, biting, using their concrete tail as a wagging battering ram. And running rapidly in small circles.<br>There are three ways of calming them down. The first being, pulling them up by their front legs, to prevent from jumping up or running around. The seond being, picking them off the ground to prevent them from moving at all. Or alternatively, three, holding them against the ground.

                Although there is a lot more to learn. This should prove to be an informative introduction that'll prepare you for the major quirks of Violet to look out for. Good luck soldier!
